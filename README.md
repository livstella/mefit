# Project approach

### Technical tools

- Netlify - for CI/CD
- GitHub for collaboration
- Swagger UI - for endpoint documentation
- Gradle - for dependency management in backend

### Project management tools

- The project is managed through Trello
- All decisions made are written on the projects Trello board
- All tasks are delegated through Trello
- GitHub
  - Main branch are a protected branch and need to pass Netlify checks and minimum 2 reviews
  - We solve our own merge conflicts before asking for reviews on out Pull Request

### MVP

Decisions regarding the MVP has been made with the intention of being customer-centric towards our hypothetical customer in mind. For this project that means:

- Endpoints for displaying data (Create and Read) are prioritised over endpoints for editing data (Update and Delete)
- Being able to visually show functionality is prioritised over perfect backend structure

### Workflow / Teamwork

- The four members of the team are divided with two members on backend and frontend respectively
- Daily stand-up at 9.00
- Weekly meeting with our mentor, Livinus, Mondays at 10.00
- Continuous communication by:
  - Marking on Trello the task you are working on
  - Moving the task to "In progress" when work starts
  - Moving the task to "Done" when definition of done has been achieved
  - If a task cannot be marked as done, due to wait time on another task, it can be labelled with "needs more info"
- There are no expectation of weekend work
- We trust each-other's ability to organise one's own work, therefore we are flexible regarding work hours
