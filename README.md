# Project approach


### Technical tools
- Netlify - for CI/CD
- GitHub for collaboration
- Swagger UI - for endpoint documentation
- Gradle - for dependency management in backend
### Project management tools
- The project is managed through Trello
- All decisions made are written on the projects Trello board
- All tasks are delegated trhough Trello 
- GitHub
    - Main branch are a protected branch and need to pass Netlify checks and minimun 2 reviews
    - We solve our own merge conflicts before asking for reviews on out Pull Request

### MVP
Desicions regarding the MVP has been made with a the intention of being customer centric, with the hypothetical customer in mind. For this project that means:
- Endpoints for displaying data (Create and Read) are priotitised over endpoints for editing data (Update and Delete)
- Being able to visually show functionality is prioritised over perfect backend structure 



### Workflow / Teamwork
- The four memebers of the team are diveded with two memebers on backend and frontend respectively 
- Daily stand-up at 9.00
- Weekly meeting with our mentor, Livinus, Mondays at 10.00
- Continuious communication by:
    - Marking on Trello the task you are working on
    - Moving the task to "In progress" when work starts
    - Moving the task to "Done" when definition of done has been achieved 
    - If a task cannot be marked as done, due to wait time on another task, it can be labelled with "needs more info"
- There are no expectation of weekend work
- We trust eachother's ability to oganise one's own work, therefore we are flexible regarding work hours
